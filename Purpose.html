			<h3>A place to share my projects.</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Having a place to show and distribute my projects is the main reason I started this website. I could always use another platform, but it's unlikely it would be as cohesive as having my own platform. I also have the freedom of presenting it how I please rather than be restrained to the framework of whatever other platform I would use. Obviously I'm still constrained to what presents on a web page, but it's better than being restriced to whatever another website decides I should be able to do.  </p>
			<h3>Providing a place to learn.</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It's important to me that anyone who wants to use the base of this website for their own purposes can have an easy time going through and seeing how everything was done. There are plenty of websites where their page source is absolutely impossible to dissect due to disorganization and sheer amounts of code not added by hand. I'm sure there are situations where this is neccesary, though I'm sure there are many more where it is just wasted space. I'd also like to avoid having to rely off of plugins others provide, who knows how available they'll be in the future. </p>
			<h3>Works across a variety of platforms.</h3>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It's obviously important to work across both desktop and mobile. The previous two topics of being clean and easy to understand naturally translates well to a decent mobile experience. Additionally, I think this website looks wonderful with a dark-mode extension! Just another advantage of clean and simple code. </p>
